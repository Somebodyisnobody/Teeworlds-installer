# Teeworlds-installer
An batch-based installer for the game Teeworlds

This is an old project, based on up to 740 lines batch code. It works with current Teeworlds versions. I just uploaded it if someone needs it.


PS: It's a real torture to read code that was written by you in history. So please use comments in your code.
