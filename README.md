# Teeworlds-installer
A batch-based installer for the game Teeworlds

This is an old project, based on up to 740 lines batch code. It works with current Teeworlds versions on Windows. I just uploaded it if someone needs it.


## What does it do?
The installer just unzips and stores the Teeworlds-files on your PC. Teeworlds-files are stored in your program files directory, based on the version (32/64 bit) you have chosen. It manages your installations, allows parallel installations and creates an entry in your "Apps & Features" section in Windows to uninstall Teeworlds with a generated uninstaller (Hey don't look so, I invested much time for this feature!!!)
